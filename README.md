Archived: use restruct/silverstripe-latlongfield instead
=================================

CMS editor can type street address, then click search. A (draggable) pointer will be shown on a map and the field's content will be replaced with the LatLong code.

Originally abstracted from the mappable module (I think).

## Requirements
SilverStripe 3.0 or higher
